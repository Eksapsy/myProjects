# myProjects

My first github repository. 
Didn't even do it right damn. Back then, I thought that in a repository you should throw a bunch of projects together, or that I should have unrelated to the main program files in the Git Repository. Hahahah, oh god.

So, it's a Console Based Menu Navigator.

**Not gonna delete it for historical reasons** and because the project is actually ... good for someone at my level back then.
